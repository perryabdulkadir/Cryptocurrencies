# Cryptocurrencies
Using clustering machine learning algorithms to group cryptocurrencies

## Overview
In this project, I have used R Studio to analyze manufacturing data for MechaCar. I analyzed: 
1) which features of car design influence average mileage per gallon; 
2) whether suspension coils across three production lots were produced to specifications.

After that, I finished up by creating a summary of an experimental design that may be used to determine the average sticker price of MechaCar's vehicles compared to their largest competitor's.

### Resources
Software: Jupyter Notebook, Python
Python packages: pandas, path, plotly, sklearn
